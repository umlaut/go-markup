go-markup
=========

go-markup is an implementation of markdown to html converter
in Go language.

It's a port of C library upskirt (https://github.com/tanoku/upskirt).

Testing
-------

*.text files in testfiles directory are from MarkdownTest 1.0.3
(https://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown/tree/master/MarkdownTest_1.0.3/Tests)

I've used upskirt to generate corresponding _upskirt_ref.html files
(without using any extensions).

I test go-markup by converting .text files to html and comparing them
with _upskirt_ref.html files.

Todo
----

First, have to finish the port.

Second, would be nice to add textile support.
